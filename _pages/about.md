Hello all, and welcome to my page! I am Joseph Biscardi, a graduate of East Carolina University with a Bachelors of Science in Information Computer Technology with a security concentration. My hobbies include sports, blogging about new products and technologies and gaming. I also enjoy working with hardware and software - building PCs or setting up switches/routers and writing scripts and project-based code. I grew up in Rochester, NY and currently reside in Greenville, North Carolina. 

I have previous experience with help desk while working for East Carolina University and Ann's House of Nuts. I am very familiar with break/fix, and have worked on Dell, Lenovo, Mac and HP computers, scanners and printers. While working at these positions I also have experienced with Powershell, Active Directory and Windows Server. 

My coursework allowed me to gain great foundation with networking and security. Taking Cisco classes taught me TCP/IP, Routing and Switching - Subnetting/VLANs, Static and Dynamic Routes, HSRP, ACLs and other CCNA-level material. Specializing in security during my university career, I had great privilege with going through security concepts, using Linux for intrusion prevention/detection, and using different suites, such as: Nmap, BASE, Snort, BarnYard, Wireshark. I was a part of the first class to go through Palo Alto Networks material and was able to obtain my ACE certification before graduating. In addition to security and networking, I also completed courses in Microsoft Server and Redhat Linux which helped me expand my IT knowledge.
